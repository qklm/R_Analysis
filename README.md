## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* vehicle length and ground clearance have a non-random impact on mp values.
* we have a non-zero slope, as both non-random factors have significant parity
* this model does not predict mpg of prototypes well. There are multiple included factors that pull the regressive model in random directions.
